new release for google_vision, integrates Google Vision features into Dart and the command line

Hello Dart developers,

Announcing the new release of **google\_vision** {{ pubspec.version }}!

A native [Dart](https://dart.dev/) package that integrates Google Vision features, including:

* image labeling,
* face, logo, and landmark detection,
* optical character recognition (OCR),
* detection of explicit content

The v1.0.x also includes a **cli** interface. Check out the [README.md](https://github.com/faithoflifedev/google_vision/blob/main/bin/README.md) for instructions on how to use the new cli tool to use any supported commands directly from the command line.  Now you can use the power of Google Vision in a shell script.
